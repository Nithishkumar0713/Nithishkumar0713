Hi, I’m Nithish Kumar Pamidi 👋
================================

About Me
--------
I am a Computer Science graduate in Cybersecuirty domain and currently pursuing PG-DITISS (Post Graduate Diploma in IT Infrastructure, Systems & Security) at CDAC Hyderabad.

My main interest is cybersecurity. I am focused on understanding how real-world systems, networks, and web applications are secured and how common vulnerabilities arise due to misconfiguration or insecure design. I am building my foundation in security concepts step by step, with an emphasis on practical understanding rather than only theory.

Cybersecurity Skills and Learning Areas
---------------------------------------
As part of PG-DITISS, I am developing knowledge and hands-on exposure in the following areas:

- Web application security fundamentals
- Vulnerability assessment concepts and basic methodology
- Understanding common web vulnerabilities such as those in OWASP Top 10
- HTTP security headers and secure configuration practices
- Authentication, authorization, and access control basics
- Linux system security fundamentals
- Network security basics and threat awareness
- Security hardening and secure configuration practices
- Ethical and responsible security testing

---

Security Practices and Tools
----------------------------
I practice cybersecurity concepts through safe and controlled environments. My learning includes manual security checks, understanding application behavior, identifying misconfigurations, and following ethical guidelines while testing. I also use Git and GitHub to maintain clean version control practices and proper project structure.

---

Supporting Technical Skills
---------------------------
I use programming mainly as a supporting tool to better understand security concepts. I work with Python for basic scripting and learning purposes. I have experience using Django and Django REST Framework to understand secure backend and API development. I also use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand web application behavior and attack surfaces. Additionally, I use basic Bash scripting and SQLite for development and learning.

---

Hands-On Learning Approach
--------------------------
I prefer learning cybersecurity through practical work rather than theory alone. I practice concepts through lab exercises aligned with the PG-DITISS syllabus and work on small security-focused projects. I focus on applying secure coding, proper configuration, and understanding how attackers think, while strictly following ethical boundaries.

---

Projects (Learning Support)
---------------------------
One of my key learning projects is the Django Security Scanner, which I built as part of my effort to better understand web application security from a defensive perspective. Through this project, I explored how web applications can be affected by insecure configurations and missing security controls.

While working on the project, I focused on understanding HTTP security headers, secure request handling, and basic validation of user input. The project helped me connect theoretical concepts such as web vulnerabilities and misconfigurations with actual backend behavior in a web application.

I primarily use this project as a learning and practice platform to strengthen my understanding of secure backend design, REST API behavior, and how security issues can arise in real-world web applications when proper controls are not implemented.

Career Objective
----------------
My goal is to build a career in cybersecurity by starting with foundational roles where I can apply what I am learning, continuously improve my skills, and contribute to securing systems, applications, and infrastructure.
