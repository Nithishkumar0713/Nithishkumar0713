Hi, I’m Nithish Kumar Pamidi 👋
================================

About Me
--------
I am a Computer Science graduate currently pursuing **PG-DITISS (Post Graduate Diploma in IT Infrastructure, Systems & Security)** at **CDAC**.

My primary focus is on **Cybersecurity**, with an interest in understanding how systems, networks, and web applications are secured against real-world threats. I am building a strong foundation in security concepts before advancing into specialized roles such as SOC analysis, vulnerability assessment, and application security.
